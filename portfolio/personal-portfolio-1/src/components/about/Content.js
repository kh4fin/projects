    <p>
      Hello! My name is Muhammad Abdul Khafid. I am a second-semester college
      student at Universitas Nusantara PGRI Kediri (UNP Kediri), with a passion
      for programming. I have expertise in programming languages such as
      JavaScript, PHP, and Node.js. I enjoy learning and developing creative and
      interactive web applications. Outside the world of programming, I have a
      keen interest in music and gaming. I love listening to various genres of
      music and occasionally try my hand at playing musical instruments. I also
      spend my free time playing games to unwind and enjoy the challenges they
      offer. Being a student at UNP University, I am fortunate to have the
      opportunity to refine my programming skills and expand my knowledge in the
      field of technology. I have a strong drive to continue learning and
      growing in the tech world, and I hope to contribute to the development of
      innovative solutions through programming. Thank you for reading my "About
      Me". If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to
      reach out to me at <i> abdul18khafid@gmail.com</i> or through my social
      media accounts. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals
      who share similar interests and enthusiasm!
